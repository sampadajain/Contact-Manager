Using this app you can:
1. Add new contact you can upload a photo of contact.
2. Edit exsisting contact by clicking the pencil icon next to contact name.

For running Unit test cases install Karma. Karma runs on Node.js and is available as an NPM package.

1. Install NodeJS(6.11.1 or higher).
2. Install Karma: ``$ npm install karma --save-dev``
3. Install Karma plugins:``$ npm install karma-jasmine karma-chrome-launcher jasmine-core --save-dev``
4. Start Karma: Go to tests folder and execute: ``karma start``

This will run the unit testcases.

For Acceptance testing using Codeceptjs follow below setps:(Currently no testcases added for acceptance testing but will be added in next release)

```
01. Make sure NodeJS is 6.11.1 or Higher (node --version)

```


## Running the tests

Start Karma: Go to tests folder(cd app/tests/unit/) and execute: ``karma start``

## Deployment

Currently this is a single page application which doesn't connect to server. Once I develop this end-to-end with serve APIs will update this section.

## Built With

* [backbonejs](http://backbonejs.org/) - The web framework used
* [underscorejs](https://underscorejs.org/) - Dependency of backbonejs
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) - Dependency of backbonejs

## Future Enhancements
Below are planned future enahncements:

1. Validations of form fields. For ex: Only number should be allowed in phone field. Before submitting form a confirmation popup appears.
2. List view of the contacts. Currently there is only grid view. There will be a button next to grid icon on clicking of which we will see contacts in list view.
